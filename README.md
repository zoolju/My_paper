# Multi-semantic decoding of visual perception via graph neural network
This repository contains key codes used in "A pulse of fMRI increases in subcortical arousal systems during transitions in attention" - Rong et al, 2022.

A detailed description of all methods used in the paper are given in the methods section of the manuscript. However, to facilitate reproducability of our results, we have included in this repository a number of key codes. 

All the data processing and model building code is based on matlab2014bï¼Œ python3.7 and pytorch 1.01

# Text_processing
codes for processing the text labels of images
# fMRI_processing
codes for processing the fMRI data
# model
main codes of f-SGL
